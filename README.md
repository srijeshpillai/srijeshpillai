### Hi there üëã, I'm Srijesh Pillai

I am an aspiring researcher in **Statistics and Data Science**, with a strong interest in applying robust statistical methods and machine learning to solve complex, real-world problems.

My core research interests include:
*   ü§ñ **Bayesian Inference & Decision Theory:** Building models that quantify uncertainty and drive optimal, data-driven decisions.
*   üìà **Time-Series Forecasting:** Developing predictive models for supply chain and demand planning, especially in dynamic environments.
*   üîä **Signal Processing & ML:** Extracting meaningful features from complex signals (like audio) for classification tasks.
*   üì° **IoT & Sensor Fusion:** Architecting end-to-end systems for collecting and analyzing real-world data for monitoring and control.
